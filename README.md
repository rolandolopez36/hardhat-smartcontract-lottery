# hardhat-smartcontract-lottery
The Hardhat Smart Contract Lottery Project is a DApp where users join a raffle by paying a small fee. The winner is chosen fairly using Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function). Developed with Solidity for smart contracts and Hardhat for development, deployment, and testing, this project ensures a secure and decentralized lottery experience.
